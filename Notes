Class 1 - Cucumber

Cucumber - it is a tool that supports BDD

Given - pre condition
When - to perform actions
And - supporting tag
Then - expected result/outcome


US - 2345 - Search employee by id
Given user is able to open chrome browser
When user enters username and password
And user clicks on login button
Then user is navigated to dashboard page
When user clicks on PIM option
And user clicks on employee list option
When user enters id in the employee id field
And user clicks on search button
Then user is able to see the employee

-- Cucumbers encourages code reusability concept

main - the code we write to develop the application, we write under main

develop the application
to test the application

test - the code we write to test the application, we write under test

2 things we have in every project

- coding - java
- non - java  - properties file, excel etc.

coding will be at one place
non java will be at another place


-- to write gherkin scenarios, we use feature files



Valid admin login
Given user is navigated to HRMS application
When user enters admin username and password
And clicks on login button
Then admin user is successfully logged in

scenario - every scenario is considered as one test case

why we don't need system.setproperty() -  "driver/chromedriver.exe"
if the path is incorrect to webdriver - it will fail, path is limited to one machine
many time it is not compatible with browser

we use webdrivermanager from now onwards


Class 2 -

--  Recap --
  -- Cucumber - it is a tool that supports BDD
  -- Gherkin language we use to write BDD
  -- Feature, Scenario, Given, When, Then, And

What is framework -
    -- it is an organized structure which allows us to write clean and maintainable code

    Feature file - declare steps in it
